                        Academic Writing Analytics or AWA (pronounced ay-wah) is a web application designed to provide insights to students on their writing. AWA comes in 2 flavours: An analytic version for analysing normal analytical style academic writing, and a reflection version for analysing reflective writing. Both flavours are actively being developed as part of CIC research projects (See the project page for more information). Some of the research that has underpinned the development to this point is documented in the resources below.

                        If you’re interested in how AWA works and why we are piloting it in UTS, these articles provide more detail. UTS:CIC is collaborating with researchers at The Open University UK, and with Xerox Research Centre Europe, who are providing part of AWA’s capability with their natural language processing product, the Xerox Incremental Parser (XIP).
